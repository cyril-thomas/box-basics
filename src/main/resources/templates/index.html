Trainers will work with you to scale workouts to your abilities and comfort levels, without sacrificing safety and proper form. The only difference would be the amount of weight, number of reps, and substitutions to promote the progression to the recommended workout. The workouts are meant to be intense for the individual but without sacrificing safety and proper form.</p>
