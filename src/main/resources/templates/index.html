                            <p>CrossFit Refinery welcomes all fitness levels. The same workouts elite athletes are doing
                                are the same workouts the everyday person should do. Trainers will work with you to scale
                                workouts to your
                                abilities and comfort levels, without sacrificing safety and proper form. The only difference
                                would be the
                                amount of weight, number of reps, and substitutions to promote the progression to the
                                recommended workout. The
                                workouts are meant to be intense for the individual but without sacrificing safety and proper
                                form.</p>
