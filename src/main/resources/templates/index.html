    <p class="text-justify">CrossFit may be the answer to your fitness shortcomings. At CrossFit Refinery we’re focused

    <h1>How to register?</h1>
    <br/>

    <p class="text-justify">
        Call or email us to come in for a free first-time workout. If you choose to continue you'll need to schedule
        your On-Ramp training which consists of a series of classes or personal sessions that provide an understanding
        of the basic movements we perform in CrossFit. These basic movements are the fundamentals to all the movements
        in the workouts and it is important that you are familiar with the movements and able to perform them correctly
        and safely.
        Once you have completed classes covering the seven basic movements, you’re invited to sign up for a program that
        fits your schedule and fitness goals. A Workout of the day or “WOD” is posted for each of the classes. The
        prescribed WOD will change daily and is constantly varied to prevent the routine and monotony that is typical
        for most fitness programs. If you would like to attend one of our introductory classes, check the schedule to
        see which one works for you or call us to schedule an individual session.</p>

    <p class="text-justify">CrossFit Refinery welcomes all fitness levels. The same workouts elite athletes are doing
        are the same workouts the everyday person should do. Trainers will work with you to scale workouts to your
        abilities and comfort levels, without sacrificing safety and proper form. The only difference would be the
        amount of weight, number of reps, and substitutions to promote the progression to the recommended workout. The
        workouts are meant to be intense for the individual but without sacrificing safety and proper form.</p>
